# wave a flag

## process
### step-1
I always open unknown files in Notepad first. This one just gave a load of ASCII as per usual. Let's scroll to see if the flag there.
### step-2
I found a string. `Hello user! Pass me a -h to learn what I can do! -h     Oh, help? I actually don't do much, but I do have this flag here: picoCTF{b1scu1ts_4nd_gr4vy_d6969390}  I don't know what '%s' means! I do know what -h means though!`
I hope it's not a dummy flag though.
## flag
`picoCTF{b1scu1ts_4nd_gr4vy_d6969390}`
